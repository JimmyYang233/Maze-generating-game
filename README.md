# Maze generating game
# A simple game that generate a maze with the code in random 8*8 maze generator. 
# Use A,S,D,W and mouse to move the character
# Press space to jump really high(the jump is straight up, and you can not move when you jump). 
# Walk to the edge to make a new row of the maze
# Collect the yellow projectile in the maze to get projectiles
# press F to shoot a projectile. 
# If you shoot a wall three times, the wall will break. 
# If you shoot to an empty edge, it will create the last row of the maze and the last wall. 
# The goal is to reach the red cube(which is on the left of where you spawn)
# All the cells can be reached, and there is definitely a way to walk to the goal.
